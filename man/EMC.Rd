\item{nbIndividuals}{: number on individuals in the population 5 by default}

\item{startingIndividuals}{: starting individuals, randomly initialized by default 
(a DataFrame containing the medication on the first column and the ADR (boolean) on the second)}

\item{startingTemperatures}{: starting temperatures, randomly initialized by default}

\item{observation}{: real observation of the ADR based on the medications of each real patients
(same form as the starting individuals)}
