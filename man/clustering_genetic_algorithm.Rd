\usage{
clustering_genetic_algorithm(
  genetic_results,
  ATCtree,
  dist.normalize = T,
  umap_config = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genetic_results}{A list of cocktails in the form of integer vector}

\item{ATCtree}{ATC tree with upper bound of the DFS}

\item{dist.normalize}{Do we normalize the distance (so it belongs to [0;1])}

\item{umap_config}{The configuration to use in order to project the cocktails in a smaller space (umap::umap.defaults by default)}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing UMAP 1/2 the two coordinates of each cocktails in the plane as well as the cluster number of each cocktails
}
